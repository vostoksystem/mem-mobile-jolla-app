# Men! for Jolla / Sailfish OS

Memory was a little application for Jolla / sailfish OS phone, meant to give you a quick look at the space available on your phone, and sdcard. With his colorful charts, always know what's on your phone. Don't like colors and categories ? no problems, just adjust to your liking.

- Display available space and memory in real time
- Quick look at stats from the cover
- Get chart of your disks occupation grouped by media type
- List all process with memory usage
- Show stats and perform backup of your sailfish App

# Why "was" ?

After several year, the team at Jolla decided to use stick rules on apps, mandatory rules, also on legacy applications.

To work Mem! require : 

- additional/external package : **forbidden**
- read access to system directories : **forbidden**
- launch external application : **forbidden**
- access android sub system : **forbidden**
- call system app : **forbidden**
- read system setting : **forbidden**
etc...

Basically all key features of this app are now impossible (for regular users), therefore, I stopped any development and event move away - as many - from the Jolla mobile device.

# Legacy

Note this app is **unmaintained** I won't be able to help you.

This is the last full code - even additional lib - of the app. I cannot guaranty it will even build on the la QTCreator version but this is a good example for how to structure a Cpp / QT app, mobile or desktop.
